[OBJECTIVE]
Build the compliance dashboard with statistics, insights, and questionnaire progress.

[REQUIREMENTS]
1. Summary statistics cards (total, passed, failed, etc.)
2. Compliance percentage gauge/chart
3. Questionnaire completion progress
4. Controls due soon list
5. Recent test activity
6. Category breakdown chart
7. Install Recharts library: `npm install recharts`

[TECHNICAL DETAILS]

API endpoint:
- GET /api/dashboard - returns all dashboard data

Dashboard layout (2-column grid on desktop, single column on mobile):

### Row 1: Key Metrics (4 cards)

1. Summary Cards (top row):
- Total Controls: 100 (with "X applicable" subtitle)
- Passed: X (green) — includes Pass and PassPrevious
- Failed: X (red)
- Not Attempted: X (gray)

### Row 2: Progress Indicators (2 cards)

2. Compliance Gauge (left):
- Circular/radial progress showing percentage
- Large percentage number in center
- Color: Green if >80%, yellow 50-80%, red <50%
- Subtitle: "X of Y applicable controls passed"

3. Questionnaire Progress (right):
- Circular/radial progress showing completion percentage
- Calculate: (total questions answered / total questions) * 100
- Subtitle: "X of 503 questions answered"
- Secondary stats below:
  - Controls with complete responses: X/100
  - Controls with partial responses: X/100
  - Controls not started: X/100

### Row 3: Lists (2 columns)

4. Due Soon (left, next 30 days):
- Table: Control #, Name, Due Date, Days Until Due
- Based on next_due_date in organisation_controls
- Max 10 items, sorted by due date (soonest first)
- Color code: Red if overdue, amber if <7 days, default otherwise
- Click row to navigate to control
- Empty state: "No controls due in the next 30 days"

5. Recent Activity (right):
- Last 10 test runs across all controls
- Show: Date (relative, e.g., "2 hours ago"), Control #, Status badge
- Click row to navigate to control
- Empty state: "No tests recorded yet"

### Row 4: Charts (full width)

6. Category Breakdown:
- Stacked horizontal bar chart (one bar per category)
- Shows pass/fail/not attempted counts per category
- Categories: ISMS Requirements, Organisational, People, Physical, Technological
- Use Recharts BarChart with stacked bars
- Legend showing Pass (green), Fail (red), Not Attempted (gray)
- Click category to filter controls list (optional enhancement)

[API RESPONSE STRUCTURE]
```typescript
interface DashboardData {
  summary: {
    total_controls: number;
    applicable_controls: number;
    passed: number;
    failed: number;
    not_attempted: number;
    blocked: number;
    continual_improvement: number;
  };
  compliance: {
    percentage: number;
    passed_count: number;
    applicable_count: number;
  };
  questionnaire_progress: {
    total_questions: number;           // 503
    answered_questions: number;
    percentage: number;
    controls_complete: number;         // All questions answered
    controls_partial: number;          // Some questions answered
    controls_not_started: number;      // No questions answered
  };
  due_soon: Array<{
    control_number: string;
    control_name: string;
    due_date: string;
    days_until_due: number;
    last_tested: string | null;
  }>;
  recent_activity: Array<{
    test_date: string;
    control_number: string;
    control_name: string;
    status: string;
    tester_name: string;
  }>;
  category_breakdown: Array<{
    category_name: string;
    passed: number;
    failed: number;
    not_attempted: number;
  }>;
}
```

[CALCULATIONS]

Compliance %:
- Formula: (Passed / Applicable Controls) * 100
- Exclude non-applicable controls from calculation
- "Passed" includes both Pass and PassPrevious statuses

Questionnaire Progress:
- Count all non-empty responses in implementation_responses.responses array
- Sum across all organisation_controls records
- Total possible: 503 questions

Days Until Due:
- Calculate: next_due_date - today
- Negative values = overdue

[STYLING]

Use existing Linear-style design:
- Cards: white bg, shadow-sm, rounded-lg
- Progress circles: Use Recharts RadialBarChart or custom SVG
- Status colors: green-500 (pass), red-500 (fail), zinc-400 (not attempted)
- Overdue highlighting: red-100 bg with red-700 text
- Due soon (≤7 days): amber-100 bg with amber-700 text
