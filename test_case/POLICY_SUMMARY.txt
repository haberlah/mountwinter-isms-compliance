INTENTIONAL TESTING ELEMENTS
=============================================================================

For ISO 27001 compliance testing purposes, the following subtle 
gaps/issues are included to test compliance detection:

1. POL-008: No clean desk policy mentioned (implicit requirement)
2. POL-009: Clear desk requirements integrated, no dedicated section
3. POL-011: No emergency change procedure - completely omitted
4. POL-012: Key management section deliberately thin/vague
5. POL-013: OVERDUE FOR REVIEW (approval date 6 Dec 2024, next review 
           6 Dec 2025, document created 15 Feb 2026)
6. POL-014: Subtly missing APP 8 (Cross-border Disclosure) from detailed 
           coverage while listed in principles section

These gaps are suitable for compliance scanning software testing.
