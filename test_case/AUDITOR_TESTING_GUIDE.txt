FORM FOOTER NOTE (WEAK COMPENSATING CONTROL):
"NOTE: This form does not include access review or expiry date fields.
 Access will be reviewed on an annual basis."

Problems with this compensating control:
1. Stated only in footer, not enforced by form
2. Annual review is TOO INFREQUENT (should be at least semi-annual)
3. No automatic expiry mechanism
4. No escalation if review deadline missed
5. Relies on manual process, not documented in form

AUDIT QUESTIONS:
Q1: Does form include access expiry date field? ✗ NO
Q2: Does form include access review date field? ✗ NO
Q3: Is annual review adequate? ✗ NO (should be more frequent)
Q4: Are expiry dates enforced? ✗ NO (no system field)
Q5: Is compensating control adequate? ✗ NO (footer note, not enforced)

EXPECTED AUDITOR CONCLUSIONS:
CONTROL GAP IDENTIFIED:

1. Missing Expiry Date Control:
   - Access grants lack defined expiry dates
   - No time limit on access grants
   - Risk: Former employee access may not be revoked promptly
   - Impact: MODERATE CONTROL WEAKNESS

2. Inadequate Review Frequency:
   - Annual review is below best practice
   - Recommended: Semi-annual or quarterly review
   - Annual review creates 12-month exposure window
   - Impact: PREVENTIVE CONTROL WEAKNESS

3. No Automatic Expiry Mechanism:
   - Form does not enforce expiry dates
   - Reliant on manual processes
   - No system-enforced controls
   - Impact: OPERATIONAL RISK

4. Form Design Gap:
   - Lacks critical access control fields
   - Compensating control (footer note) is weak
   - Note is not enforced
   - Impact: DESIGN AND DOCUMENTATION GAP

REMEDIATION REQUIRED:
1. Add "Access Review Date" field (recommend quarterly or semi-annual)
2. Add "Access Expiry Date" field (maximum 1 year)
3. Implement system controls to enforce expiry
4. Create process to notify manager before expiry
5. Create process to automatically disable access at expiry
6. Remove reliance on annual manual reviews alone

COMPLIANCE REFERENCE:
ISO 27001 requires:
- Access rights to be reviewed regularly
- Access to be revoked promptly when no longer needed
- Time-limited access grants with automatic expiry
- Documented access control procedures

AUDITOR TEST OBJECTIVE:
Can auditor identify missing access review and expiry date fields,
and recognize that annual reviews are inadequate? ✓ TEST COMPETENCY
