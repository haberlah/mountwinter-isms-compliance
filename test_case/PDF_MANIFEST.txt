2. SSA-002_Supplier_Assessment_DataVault.pdf
   ──────────────────────────────────────────
   Size: 3.3 KB | Pages: 1
   Date: 22 May 2025
   Assessor: Marcus Lee (IT Security Analyst)

   Content:
   - Thin/incomplete supplier security assessment for DataVault Solutions
   - Assessment of offsite backup provider
   - Assessment findings table with 5 areas, mostly marked "N/A" or "PARTIAL"
   - Incident notification NOT reviewed during assessment
   - Compliance certifications marked "N/A" - NO evidence review conducted
   - Several findings marked "ASSUMED" without documented verification
   - Overall Risk Rating: MEDIUM (but weak justification)
   - Recommendation: APPROVED (despite obvious gaps)

   Quality: LOW - Deliberately incomplete, hasty assessment
   Auditor Concern: CRITICAL - This assessment shows poor due diligence:
     * Missing certification validation (marked N/A)
     * Incident notification procedures not reviewed
     * Weak justifications for MEDIUM risk rating
     * Approval despite identified gaps
     * No evidence of control verification
   Finding: Red flag for auditors - suggests assessment was rushed


3. PEN-001_Penetration_Test_Report_Aug2025.pdf
   ────────────────────────────────────────────
   Size: 6.8 KB | Pages: 3
   Date: 18 August 2025

   Quality: PROFESSIONAL - Well-structured, comprehensive report

     * Critical SQL injection marked "Remediation In Progress" but no completion date
     * Two High severity findings still Open since August 2025
     * This indicates delayed remediation of critical vulnerabilities
     * Red flag: Why were critical/high findings not fixed within 30/60 days?


4. FRM-001_Access_Request_Form_Template.pdf
   ──────────────────────────────────────────

     * NO "access expiry date" field
     * Form note says "will be reviewed on an annual basis" but nothing on form
     * This is a gap - access should have defined expiry dates

     * Red flag: Lack of intrusion detection is a control gap
     * Network architecture should include monitoring/detection systems
