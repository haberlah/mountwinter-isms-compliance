## SECTION 1: ISMS Requirements (Clauses 4-10)

### Control RQ4: Context of the Organisation; Scope

**CPS 234 Reference:** 15, 17

| ID | Question | Evidence Guidance | Auditor Focus |
|----|----------|-------------------|---------------|
| 1 | **Provide the documented internal and external issues affecting your ISMS.** | Look for: SWOT/PESTLE analysis, regulatory landscape (APRA, Privacy Act), competitive environment, technology changes, threat landscape. Document must be dated and show review within 12 months. | Is this organisation-specific or generic template? |
| 2 | **Show me your interested parties register with their documented requirements.** | Must include: Customers, APRA, shareholders, employees, suppliers, partners. Each party should have specific security requirements documented (not generic "expects security"). | Are requirements traceable to controls? |
| 3 | **Present your ISMS scope document.** | Scope must specify: Physical/logical boundaries, business units, locations, systems, data types, cloud infrastructure (AWS/Azure/GCP), CI/CD pipelines, customer data processing activities. Must state interfaces and dependencies. | Does scope cover all information assets? Are cloud services explicitly included? |
| 4 | **What is explicitly excluded from scope, and what is the justification?** | Exclusions need documented risk-based justification. Red flag: Excluding critical systems without valid reasoning (e.g., "legacy system excluded" without compensating controls). | Is the exclusion justified by risk assessment? |
| 5 | **Provide evidence of context review within the last 12 months.** | Management review minutes discussing context changes, updated context document with version history, change log showing updates. | Was review triggered by actual changes or just annual checkbox? |
| 6 | **How does your scope address cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and customer data flows?** | For SaaS: Explicit coverage of cloud provider configurations, deployment pipelines, API endpoints, data processing locations, multi-tenant architecture. | If cloud-based, scope should be detailed on shared responsibility. |

**Common Nonconformities:**
- Cookie-cutter context documents lacking organisation-specific detail
- Scope excluding systems that process sensitive data
- No evidence of annual review with management engagement

### Control RQ5: Leadership and Commitment

**CPS 234 Reference:** 13, 14

| ID | Question | Evidence Guidance | Auditor Focus |
|----|----------|-------------------|---------------|
| 1 | **Provide meeting attendance records showing C-suite participation in ISMS governance.** | Look for: CEO/CFO/COO names on sign-in sheets, board meeting minutes discussing security, agenda items showing security as standing topic. Red flag: Delegation without attendance. | "Did the CEO actually attend, or did they delegate?" |
| 2 | **Show me the current information security policy with executive approval signature.** | Policy must have: Executive signature (CEO/Board), approval date within 12 months, version control, organisation-specific content (not generic template). | Is the signature recent? Is policy organisation-specific? |
| 3 | **Present your RACI matrix defining security roles, responsibilities, and authorities.** | RACI should include: Named individuals (not just roles), clear accountability for ISMS, control owners, incident response authorities. Must align with org chart. | Are responsibilities clear? No gaps or overlaps? |
| 4 | **Provide evidence of security budget allocation and resource decisions.** | Budget documents, headcount approvals, tool procurement records, meeting minutes showing resource discussions and decisions. | Is security resourced adequately? |
| 5 | **How does management demonstrate commitment to continual improvement?** | Management review outputs with improvement actions, security investment decisions, KPI reviews showing management response to metrics, improvement initiatives with executive sponsorship. | Are improvements driven by data or just compliance? |
| 6 | **How are security objectives communicated organisation-wide?** | All-hands communications, intranet announcements, training materials, town hall presentations, security newsletter. Evidence of staff awareness. | Can random staff articulate security objectives? |

**Common Nonconformities:**
- Leadership involvement limited to policy signature only
- No evidence of C-suite attending security governance meetings
- RACI matrix exists but doesn't match actual decision-making
